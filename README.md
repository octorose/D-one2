Welcome to the Diabetic Management Mobile App project! This mobile app is designed to help individuals with diabetes manage their condition more effectively. The app provides users with tools and features to monitor their blood sugar levels, track medication intake, record food consumption, and receive valuable insights to better manage their health.

## Features

The Diabetic Management Mobile App comes with the following features:

1. **Blood Sugar Tracking**: Users can record their blood sugar levels at different times of the day and track the trends over time.

2. **Medication Reminders**: The app allows users to set reminders for taking their medications, ensuring they never miss a dose.

3. **Food Journal**: Users can keep a record of their meals and snacks, including carbohydrate counts and mealtime notes.

4. **Activity Monitoring (Optional)**: In future iterations, we plan to add activity tracking to help users monitor their physical activity levels.

5. **Insights and Analytics (Future Development)**: The app aims to provide users with valuable insights and analytics based on their data to identify patterns and make informed decisions.

## Frontend

The frontend of the mobile app has been developed using Flutter, a powerful and flexible framework for building native mobile applications for Android and iOS platforms. The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) have been designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a focus on delivering a smooth and responsive experience.

## Backend (Work in Progress)

The next phase of development involves building the backend for the app. We plan to use Node.js with Express to create a robust and scalable backend that will handle user authentication, data storage, and provide APIs for the frontend to interact with the server.

## Project Setup

1. Fork the project repository to your GitHub account.

2. Create a new branch from the `main` branch for each feature or bug fix.

3. Make your changes and additions, ensuring that the code is well-documented and follows best practices.

4. Test your changes locally to avoid any potential issues.

5. Once you are confident with your changes, create a pull request to merge your branch into the `main` branch.

6. Discuss your changes with the maintainers and incorporate feedback to improve the project.

7. Be respectful and collaborative in the development process.

## Future Roadmap

As this project progresses, we have some exciting features planned for future development:

- Integration with Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices to enable real-time data tracking.
- Enhanced data visualization to help users better understand their health trends.
- Integration with health professionals to provide personalized recommendations and support.
- Multi-language support to make the app accessible to a wider user base.
